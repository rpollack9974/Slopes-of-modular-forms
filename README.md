# Slopes-of-modular-forms

This repository contains code to 

a) compute rhobar-slopes of modular forms (that is slopes attached to eigenforms with a fixed residual representation)

b) compute rhobar-ghost slopes (that is the slopes computed by the rhobar-ghost series)

In the regular case, these slopes should match.
